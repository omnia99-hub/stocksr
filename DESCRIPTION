Title: Sector-Wise Random Forest Modeling and Analysis for S&P 500 Data
Version: 0.1.0

Description: 
    The 'stocksr' package provides tools to load, process, and analyze S&P 500 
    stock price data grouped by sectors (e.g., Technology, Energy, Health Care). 
    It computes sector-level indices, enriches the data with technical indicators, 
    and fits Random Forest models to predict sector performance. The package 
    supports model tuning using time-series cross-validation and provides 
    performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²) for comparison across sectors. 
    Functions are designed to be modular and support parallel computation 
    for scalable analysis.
