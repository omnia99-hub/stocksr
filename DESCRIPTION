Description: 
    The 'stocksr' package provides tools to load, process, and analyze S&P 500 
    stock price data specifically for the Energy and Healthcare sectors. 
    It computes sector-level indices, enriches the data with technical 
    indicators, and fits Random Forest and LSTM models to predict sector 
    performance. The package includes functions for data cleaning, feature 
    engineering, time-series preparation, model building, and performance 
    evaluation (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²). Designed for ease of use and scalability in 
    sector-based financial analysis.
