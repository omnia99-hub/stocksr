\title{Compare model performance across sectors}
\usage{
compare_sectors(sector_models)

compare_sectors(sector_models)
}
\arguments{
\item{sector_models}{A named list of model evaluation results for each sector
.Each element in the list should be a list with numeric components `rmse`,
`mae`, and `r2`, typically returned by a model-building function.}
}
\value{
A data frame comparing model performance.

A data frame containing performance metrics (`RMSE`, `MAE`, and `R2`)
        for each sector, sorted in descending order of `R2`.
}
\description{
Summarizes RMSE, MAE, and R² for each sector's model.

This function summarizes and visualizes the performance of models built
for different sectors. It prints and plots RMSE and R² for each sector
and returns a sorted comparison data frame.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Suppose you have results from multiple models
models <- list(
  Technology = list(rmse = 20.5, mae = 15.2, r2 = 0.89),
  Financial = list(rmse = 25.1, mae = 18.3, r2 = 0.81),
  Energy = list(rmse = 30.2, mae = 22.8, r2 = 0.75)
)

# Compare them
sector_summary <- compare_sectors(models)
print(sector_summary)
