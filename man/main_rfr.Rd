\title{Run Full Random Forest Analysis Pipeline}
\usage{
main_rfr()
}
\value{
None. The function prints progress updates, comparison metrics,
and plots. It optionally stores model metrics in `sector_models` and plots
feature importance.
}
\description{
Executes the complete analysis pipeline using the Random Forest algorithm for
all sectors. It includes loading and preprocessing the stock dataset,
computing sector indices and technical indicators, training a Random Forest
model per sector, and comparing model performance across sectors. It also
visualizes feature importance for the best-performing sector.
