\title{Build Random Forest Model for Sector Index}
\usage{
build_random_forest_model(sector_data, sector_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{sector_data}{A data frame containing the engineered features, including
`sector_index`, `returns`, lagged features, and technical indicators.
The data must have a `Date` column and a `sector_index` column as the
target.}

\item{sector_name}{A character string giving the name of the sector, used in
print outputs and plot title.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
  \item{model}{The trained Random Forest model object.}
  \item{rmse}{Root Mean Squared Error on the test set.}
  \item{mae}{Mean Absolute Error on the test set.}
  \item{r2}{R-squared score on the test set.}
  \item{feature_importance}{A data frame showing feature importance ranked
  by IncNodePurity.}
}
}
\description{
Trains and evaluates a Random Forest regression model to predict a sector's
index based on engineered features. The function performs an 80/20 time-based
split for training and testing, computes performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²),
and visualizes predicted vs actual values. It also returns the feature
importance rankings.
