## Overview

The `load_and_preprocess_data()` function in the **stocksr** package is designed to load historical S&P 500 stock price data from an Excel file and organize it into **sector-wise groups**. 

Each sector is returned as a separate data frame, containing:
- One column for `Date`
- One column per company within that sector

This function is especially useful for:
- Performing **sector-level financial analysis**
- Building **machine learning models** on grouped company data

---

## What the Function Does

The function performs the following steps:

-  **Reads** an Excel file where:
  - Rows represent daily price observations
  - Columns represent individual companies

- **Maps** each company to its corresponding sector  
  _(e.g., Energy, Health Care)_

- **Creates** a data frame for each sector that includes:
  - `Date` as the first column
  - Stock prices of the companies in that sector

- **Returns** a named list of sector-specific data frames
```{r example}
# Load and preprocess
sectors_data <- load_and_preprocess_data(df_cleaned2)

# View available sectors
names(sectors_data)
```
## View a Sample Sector

```{r preview-sector, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Preview the first few rows of the Energy sector
head(sectors_data$Energy)
```

## Sector Mapping Reference

The `load_and_preprocess_data()` function internally maps companies to the following sectors:

- **Energy:** Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Schlumberger, EOG Resources, etc.
- **Health Care:** Johnson & Johnson, UnitedHealth Group, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Merck & Company, etc.


## Return Value

The function returns a **named list of data frames**, where each name corresponds to a sector.

Each sector data frame contains:

- `Date`: The trading date  
- Stock prices for all companies in that sector (one column per company)

## Inspect Sector Data Structure
```{r}
# Check the structure of the Energy sector data
str(sectors_data$Energy)
```

## Calculating Sector Index from S&P 500 Data

The `calculate_sector_index()` function computes the **average stock price across all companies in a sector** for each date, creating a simple sector-level time series. This is especially useful as input for forecasting or machine learning models.

### How It Works

- Takes a **sector-specific data frame** (e.g., `sectors_data$Energy`) created using `load_and_preprocess_data()`
- Handles missing values using linear interpolation (`na.approx`) and bidirectional filling (`fill`)
- Computes a row-wise average of all company columns
- Returns a data frame with:
  - `Date`: The trading date
  - `sector_index`: The average of all company prices in that sector

### Apply to this Data

```{r calculate-sector-index, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Compute sector index for the Energy sector
tech_index <- calculate_sector_index(sectors_data$Energy)

# View the result
head(tech_index)
```

## Calculating Technical Indicators for Sector Index

The `calculate_technical_indicators()` function in the `stocksr` package enriches a sector index time series with widely used technical indicators. These features are valuable for capturing patterns like momentum, trend, and volatilityâ€”key components for predictive modeling in finance.

### What Are Technical Indicators?

The function calculates the following indicators:

#### *Daily Returns**

The daily return \( R_t \) is computed as the percent change from the previous day's index:

\[
R_t = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}}
\]

Where:
- \( P_t \) is the sector index at time \( t \)
- \( R_t \) is the return on day \( t \)


#### *Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**

The SMA over \( n \) days is:

\[
\text{SMA}_t = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P_{t-i}
\]

Used for smoothing trends over time. The function includes:
- SMA over 5, 10, and 20 days

#### *Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**

The EMA assigns more weight to recent prices. It's calculated recursively as:

\[
\text{EMA}_t = \alpha \cdot P_t + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \text{EMA}_{t-1}
\]

Where \( \alpha = \frac{2}{n+1} \) is the smoothing factor.

The function includes:
- EMA over 5 and 10 days

#### **Rolling Volatility**

The volatility (standard deviation) over a rolling window of \( n \) days:

\[
\text{Volatility}_t = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (P_{t-i} - \bar{P})^2 }
\]

Computed for 5 and 10-day windows.


#### **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**

The RSI measures the magnitude of recent gains and losses:

\[
\text{RSI} = 100 - \left( \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average Loss}}} \right)
\]

Used to identify overbought (RSI > 70) or oversold (RSI < 30) conditions.

#### **Lagged Features**

For time series models, the function creates lagged values:

- \( \text{Lag}_k = P_{t-k} \)
- \( \text{Returns\_Lag}_k = R_{t-k} \) for \( k = 1 \) to \( 5 \)

These help capture short-term dependencies and trends.


### Apply to Sector Data

```{r sector-tech-indicators, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
tech_features <- calculate_technical_indicators(tech_index)
head(tech_features)
```


These engineered features are ready to be used in time series forecasting, machine learning pipelines, or financial dashboarding.

## Random Forest Modeling for Sector Index Prediction

The `build_random_forest_model()` function trains a **Random Forest regression model** to predict a sector's daily index using engineered features such as returns, lag values, and technical indicators. It evaluates the model using standard performance metrics and provides feature importance to interpret the model.

### What is a Random Forest?

A **Random Forest** is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions. In regression tasks, it averages the results from each tree to provide a robust, stable prediction.

**Why use Random Forests for financial data?**

- Handles non-linear relationships between features and response  
- Robust to noise and overfitting  
- Provides built-in feature importance for interpretation  
- Performs well on datasets with many engineered variables (like technical indicators)

### How the Function Works

The `build_random_forest_model()` function performs the following steps:

1. **Input**: A data frame with:
   - `Date`
   - `sector_index` (target)
   - Engineered features (technical indicators, returns, lags, etc.)

2. **Split the data**:
   - 80% for training
   - 20% for testing
   - Chronological order is preserved to respect time-dependence

3. **Train the model**:
   - A Random Forest is trained on the training set using `randomForest::randomForest()`  
   - Parameters include `ntree = 100`, `mtry = sqrt(p)`, `nodesize = 5`

4. **Evaluate**:
   - Calculates:
     - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
     - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
     - **\( R^2 \)** (Coefficient of Determination)
   - Plots actual vs predicted values

5. **Feature Importance**:
   - Displays top variables ranked by `IncNodePurity`

### Apply to Your Data

```{r build-rf-model, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Train and evaluate the model
rf_energy <- build_random_forest_model(tech_features, "Energy")
```

### Output

The function returns a named list:

| Name               | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`            | The trained `randomForest` object                            |
| `rmse`             | Root Mean Squared Error on the test set                      |
| `mae`              | Mean Absolute Error on the test set                          |
| `r2`               | R-squared score on the test set                              |
| `feature_importance` | Data frame ranking features by `IncNodePurity`            |

This modeling function is a key part of the `stocksr` pipeline and can be extended to all sectors for comparative performance analysis.

```{r}
# Step 3: View results
rf_energy$rmse
rf_energy$mae
rf_energy$r2
```
The model achieved strong predictive performance:

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is approximately 0.769, indicating that, on average, the model's predicted sector index values deviate from the actual values by less than one unit.
The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is about 0.527, meaning that the model's absolute prediction errors are slightly more than half a unit, demonstrating consistency in predictions.
Importantly, the R-squared (RÂ²) value is approximately 0.996, suggesting that 99.6% of the variance in the Energy sector index is captured by the model.
These results confirm that the Random Forest model provides an excellent fit for the sector index forecasting task based on the engineered technical indicators.
